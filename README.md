# Talking InvisibleCamera
Talking Invisible Camera features to make a person invisible exactly where he/she uses a dark blue colored cloak or cloth to cover his/her body. The algorithm inspiration was taken from Harry Potter where he receives an invisible cloak to disappear himself. The camera calls out the name of the person to greet them and then follows the invisibility instructions. Kindly refer to the following tutorial to obtain the best results:
1. Place your camera steady to obtain the best results. Don't shake or move it.
2. Run the program test.py and don't move in front of camera until it speaks calibrated image is ready.
3. I have used google engine to speak the names, you can change Shivam to your name so that they will call your name.
4. Once this is done, now open just_show.py and run the code. Make sure your covering image must be blue in color.
5. In case you want to switch to some other color of invisible cloak, use the program hsv_filter.py adjust the trackbar to give desired results. The filtered Image will be displayed in the window and keep filtering until you obtain exactly what you want, once done replace these values to that of blue_L and blue_H in just_show.py.
6. Make sure you only run hsv_filter.py and not hsvVsRGB as that program is for comparision between hsv and rgb based filtering.
7. Everything is good to go now, Enjoy your virtual invisible cloak. ;D
